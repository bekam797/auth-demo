# Auth Demo

This project demonstrates a simple authentication flow in React using the Context API and `useReducer` hook.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bekam797/auth-demo.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd auth-demo
3. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install or yarn
4. **Start the development server:** 
    ```bash
    npm start or yarn start

The app should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

## Notes
- This project uses ESLint with Prettier for linting and code formatting.
- No backend is integrated; the authentication flow is simulated for demonstration purposes.
